Overview
========

NLNZ Tools Scripts Ingestion is a common set of scripts related to the generation of SIPs for ingestion into the Rosetta
archiving system. The aim is to provide useful scripts related to SIP generation and ingestion. These scripts do not fit
into a traditional project paradigm (for example, they may be bash, Python or Groovy scripts that are run independently
of a project).

Motivation
----------
We want to keep track of our scripts to better share and support them.

What it is *NOT*
----------------

- It is *NOT* specific to a particular ingestion.


History
=======

The National Library of New Zealand has a legal mandate, and a social responsibility, to preserve New Zealand's social
and cultural history, be it in the form of books, newspapers and photographs, or of websites, blogs and videos.
Increasing amounts of New Zealand's documentary heritage is only available online. Users find this content valuable and
convenient, but its impermanence, lack of clear ownership, and dynamic nature pose significant challenges to any
institution that attempts to acquire and preserve it.

NLNZ Tools Scripts Ingestion is a common set of functionality for use in ingesting custom ingestion types. The first such
problem is the so-called *fairfax* ingestion, which is a feed from Fairfax of their digital print publications.

There are some related code repositories as well:

    - https://github.com/NLNZDigitalPreservation/nlnz-tools-sip-generation
    - https://github.com/NLNZDigitalPreservation/nlnz-tools-sip-generation-fairfax

Project objectives
------------------

-   Meets the needs of the National Library of New Zealand
-   Possibly provide helpful functionality or example processing to other users and institutions.

The tool is open-source software and is freely available for the benefit of the international archiving community.


Versioning
==========
These scripts are not under a project, so there are no versions associated with them, although each script may have a
version number embedded within.


Installation
============
There are no artifacts that are created or installed.
